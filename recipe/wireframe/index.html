<!-- Over the next couple of weeks, you will be designing and building a recipe web page. This week's assignment is to choose a recipe, gather assets and build a responsive wireframe of the website.

Content must include:

Title
Description / teaser
Photo(s)
Ingredients list
Step-by-step instructions
Author / source attribution
Wireframe requirements:

Must limit content-area width to 960px
Must function down to 320px wide
Image must scale with window
Ingredients and instructions must be presented side-by-side above 640px
Focus on structure for now, decorative style comes later -->

                            <h3>HOW TO MAKE</h3>
                        </div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <label>Step 1:</label> <br /><span>Combine all in a blender: </span
                      >Beginning with the oats until blended into a fine powder, add the
                      rest of the ingredients and blend on high until completely smooth,
                      about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Let the batter sit in your blender
                      while you heat your pan up. &nbsp;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <label>Step 2:</label> <br /><span>Prep your pan: </span>Lightly coat a griddle with coconut oil, vegan butter or olive oil and place over medium heat. Once pan is hot, add 1/3 cup of the batter to the griddle for each pancake and
                                cook for 2-4 minutes until pancakes slightly puff up and you see a few bubbles along the edges. &nbsp;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <label>Step 3:</label> <br /><span>Flip your cakes: </span>Cook until golden brown on underside. If you find that pancakes are browning too quickly then you need to lower the heat. I normally start on medium heat, then
                                decrease to medium low later so that my pancakes don't burn. If at any point your griddle starts smoking, it means your pan is too hot. &nbsp;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <label>Step 4:</label> <br /><span>Repeat until batter is gone: </span
                      >Wipe skillet clean and repeat steps 2-3 with more oil and
                      remaining batter. Makes 9 pancakes total. Serves 3, 3 pancakes
                      each. To serve, top with desired toppings, such as nut butter,
                      cinnamon, sliced bananas, chocolate chips, fresh fruit, vanilla
                      yogurt, honey, or maple syrup. You could also add a sprinkle of
                      pumpkin or chia seeds for more fiber and healthy fats! Enjoy!
